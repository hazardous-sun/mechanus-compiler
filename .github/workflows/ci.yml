    steps:
      # --- Step 1: Check out the repository code ---
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # --- Step 2: Set up the Go environment ---
      # It uses the Go version specified in your go.mod file
      - name: Set up Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v5
        with:
          go-version: '1.24' # From go.mod file

      # --- Step 3: Create the output directory ---
      # The compiler needs this directory to exist before running
      - name: Create output directory
        run: mkdir -p output

      # --- Step 4: Compile all examples and check for failures ---
      # This step iterates through all example files and runs the compiler.
      # GitHub Actions runs this script with a setting that causes it to
      # fail immediately if any command exits with a non-zero status.
