# Mechanus Compiler
This is the compiler for the Mechanus language. You can find examples of codes in Mechanus inside the 
[`examples/`](docs/examples/) directory inside [`docs`](./docs).


Mechanus is an esoteric programming language, therefore, it is *unnatural*... You write it from the bottom to 
the top, and from the left to the right.
