# Mechanus Compiler
This is the compiler for the Mechanus language. You can find examples of codes in Mechanus inside the 
[`examples/`](docs/examples/) directory inside [`docs`](./docs).

Mechanus is an esoteric programming language, therefore, it is *unnatural*... You write it from the bottom to 
the top, and from the left to the right.

The [Derivation Tree](./docs/derivation_tree.md) can be used as reference, but there is also a couple of [examples](docs/examples) showing how 
to use the language.
